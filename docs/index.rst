EYRA Tools
==========

EYRA Tools is a Python package that helps you generate Docker containers
containing a submission or evaluation for the
`EYRA Benchmark Platform <https://www.eyrabenchmark.net>`_.

Benchmark participants should implement a submission
container, while benchmark organizers should implement an evaluation container.
The Docker containers can be generated by typing:

.. code-block:: sh

    eyra-generate [submission|evaluation] <container_name> [-d <docker hub account>]

.. warning::
    EYRA Tools and the documentation are works in progress. Not everything already works as advertised.
    If you are interested in organizing a Benchmark on the EYRA Benchmark Platform,
    please contact us via info@eyrabenchmark.net.
